This package aims to provide open-source software for controlling atom probe systems and calibrating data.
The package is modular and adaptable for a wide range of devices in atom probe instrument. So far it is
capable of collecting data from Surface consept and ReoenDek TDC systems. The package is developed in Python 3.9.
Additionally, the package encompasses a comprehensive calibration module that provides various functionalities,
including t<sub>0</sub> and flight path calculation, region of interest (ROI) selection, voltage and bowl calibration,
as well as
3D reconstruction techniques.
This module enhances the capabilities of PyCCAPT by providing essential tools for accurate data interpretation and
analysis.

# Overview

PyCCAPT was initially developed and tested on the OXCART atom probe, an in-house atom probe system situated
within the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. The OXCART atom probe boasts a titanium-based measuring chamber that facilitates an ultra-low hydrogen 
vacuum environment. This system also features a state-of-the-art detector with a high detection
efficiency of approximately 80%. While tailor-made for the OXCART, the PyCCAPT package offers versatility, extending its
capabilities to effectively control atom probe systems.

The package is designed with modularity in mind, making it highly adaptable to new instruments. This
adaptability extends to instruments like Pfeifer gauges, Fug power supplies, and Siglent signal generators. Notably, the
PyCCAPT package has already demonstrated its proficiency in collecting data from Surface Concept and ReoenDek TDC
systems.

The PyCCAPT package forms the foundation of a fully FAIR atom probe data collection and processing chain. This
repository includes the graphical user interface (GUI) and control program, which enable experiment control,
visualization, and data acquisition. The following images provide an overview of the user interface:

The calibration module is another component of the PyCCAPT, providing essential tools for data calibration and
interpretation. This module includes functionalities such as t<sub>0</sub> and flight path calculation, region of
interest (ROI) selection, voltage and bowl calibration, and 3D reconstruction techniques.
